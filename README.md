# AI Manufacturing & Retail Business Companion

## Overview

Small and medium businesses don’t fail because they lack data.
They fail because they don’t know **what matters today**.

This project is an AI-powered **Business Companion** designed for manufacturing and retail SMEs.
Instead of dashboards, charts, or complex tools, the system acts like a trusted business partner that:

- Understands daily operations
- Watches patterns across production, sales, and returns
- Proactively highlights risks and opportunities
- Suggests clear next actions in simple language

Every day, the user can ask one simple question:

**“What’s up today?”**

And the AI responds with what the business owner needs to know *right now*.

## Problem

SME owners and operators:
- Juggle production, sales, inventory, and logistics
- React late to demand spikes, returns, or stock issues
- Don’t have time to analyze reports or dashboards
- Rely heavily on gut feeling instead of insights

Most AI tools today require users to:
- Ask the right questions
- Interpret charts
- Decide what to do next

This is unrealistic for day-to-day business operations.

## Solution

An AI **Business Companion** that:
- Continuously observes business data
- Proactively surfaces insights
- Explains situations in simple terms
- Recommends practical actions

The AI behaves like a calm, reliable partner who:
- Flags issues early
- Prepares the business for upcoming demand (festivals, seasonality)
- Explains *why* something is happening
- Helps the user decide *what to do next*

---

## Example

**User:** “What’s up today?”

**AI:**
- “Demand for product A is rising. Stock may run out in 4 days.”
- “Returns increased last week due to packaging damage.”
- “A festival is coming up next week. Production should be increased now.”

No dashboards.  
No alerts overload.  
Just clarity.
