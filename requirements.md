# AI Manufacturing & Retail Business Companion

## Problem Overview

Small manufacturing and retail businesses struggle to make daily decisions because
their data is scattered across sales, production, inventory, and returns.

Most existing tools provide dashboards and reports.
Very few explain what to do today — and why.

This project builds an AI-powered Business Companion that helps small manufacturers
and sellers make better day-to-day decisions across production planning, demand
forecasting, and returns analysis.

## Target Users

- Small and medium manufacturing businesses
- Owner-led factories that also sell directly or via marketplaces
- Operations managers handling both production and sales

---

## Core Goals

- Reduce guesswork in daily business decisions
- Help businesses prepare for demand spikes (festivals, promotions)
- Identify return issues early and explain root causes
- Provide clear, actionable guidance instead of raw metrics

---

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Daily Business Summary
- Highlights today’s priorities
- Flags risks and opportunities
- Explains what changed since yesterday

### 2. Demand & Production Forecasting
- Predicts short-term demand using historical sales trends
- Suggests production increases or decreases
- Accounts for seasonal and festival-driven spikes

### 3. Returns Intelligence
- Detects increases in returns
- Explains possible reasons (quality, packaging, logistics, expectations)
- Recommends corrective actions

### 4. Conversational Interaction
Users can ask natural questions such as:
- “What should I focus on today?”
- “Should I increase production next week?”
- “Why did returns increase yesterday?”
- “Which products are underperforming?”

The AI responds with:
- a simple explanation
- supporting insights
- a suggested next action

## Why AI Is Required

This is not a rules-based system.

Business decisions depend on changing and uncertain factors such as:
- seasonal demand
- festival calendars
- sudden sales spikes or drops
- supply chain delays
- quality issues reflected through returns

A static rule engine cannot adapt to these conditions.
The AI reasons over trends, patterns, and context to provide guidance,
not fixed outcomes.

## Data Approach

- Uses synthetic or simulated business data
- Can later integrate real sales, inventory, and returns data
- Designed to work with incomplete or noisy datasets common in small businesses

---

## Non-Goals

- Not an ERP replacement
- Not a static reporting dashboard
- Not a manual rules engine

---

## Success Criteria

- Users understand what action to take without reading charts
- Decisions feel simpler and more confident
- Businesses can react earlier to demand and return issues
