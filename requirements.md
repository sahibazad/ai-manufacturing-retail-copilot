# Requirements – AI Business Companion

## Objective

Build an AI-powered business companion that proactively guides manufacturing and retail SMEs in daily decision-making across production, sales, inventory, and returns.

---

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Daily Business Briefing

The system must provide a daily summary when the user asks:
- “What’s up today?”
- “Anything I should know?”

The briefing should include:
- Key risks (e.g. low stock, rising returns)
- Upcoming opportunities (e.g. festivals, demand spikes)
- Suggested priorities for the day

---

### 2. Proactive Insights

The system must:
- Continuously analyze historical and recent data
- Detect meaningful patterns or anomalies
- Surface insights **without requiring explicit queries**

Examples:
- Unusual return patterns
- Production not matching demand
- Seasonal demand approaching

---

### 3. Conversational Explanation

The system must explain insights in:
- Simple, non-technical language
- Short, clear sentences
- Cause → effect → recommendation format

Example:
- “Returns increased because packaging was weak. Reinforcing boxes can reduce damage.”

---

### 4. Action Suggestions

When relevant, the system should recommend actions such as:
- Increase or reduce production
- Adjust packaging or logistics
- Prepare inventory ahead of festivals
- Investigate specific products or suppliers

Suggestions are advisory, not automatic actions.

---

### 5. Learning Over Time

The system must improve recommendations by:
- Learning from past outcomes
- Observing seasonal trends
- Adapting to the specific business context

---

## Data Constraints

- Uses synthetic or publicly available datasets
- No sensitive or personal customer data
- Clearly states assumptions and limitations

---

## Non-Goals

- No complex dashboards
- No rule-based “if-this-then-that” logic
- No automatic execution of business actions
