# AI Manufacturing & Retail Copilot

## Problem Statement
Small and mid-sized manufacturing businesses struggle to manage production planning, inventory, sales, and returns using fragmented tools and manual decision-making. This often leads to overproduction, stockouts, delayed deliveries, and poor visibility into why issues occur.

## Objective
Build an AI-powered copilot that helps manufacturing businesses make smarter, faster decisions by combining manufacturing data and retail data into a single, intelligent system.

The copilot should:
- Monitor production, inventory, and sales in one place
- Explain *what is happening* and *why*
- Recommend actions in simple, human language

## Target Users
- Small and mid-sized manufacturers
- Factory owners and operations managers
- Sales and supply chain teams
- Businesses that both **produce and sell** products

## Key Use Cases
- Detect unusual spikes in demand (e.g., festivals, seasonal trends)
- Recommend increasing or reducing production
- Explain reasons behind high returns or low sales
- Track inventory health across warehouses
- Answer natural language questions like:
  - “Why are returns high this week?”
  - “Should we produce more next month?”
  - “Which product is underperforming and why?”

## Why AI Is Needed
Traditional dashboards show numbers but do not explain meaning or suggest actions.

AI enables:
- Pattern detection across large datasets
- Natural language explanations
- Forecasting future demand
- Intelligent recommendations instead of static reports

## Expected Outcomes
- Better production planning
- Reduced waste and stockouts
- Faster decision-making
- Improved understanding of business performance

## Constraints & Assumptions
- Uses synthetic or sample data for the prototype
- Designed for scalability to real-world systems
- Focuses on clarity and usability over complexity

## Success Criteria
- Clear demonstration of AI-driven insights
- Easy-to-understand explanations
- Practical business value for manufacturers
- Feels usable by non-technical users
